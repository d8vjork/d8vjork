### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Social-chan, Dojo, many of many packages of Laravel, also doing some very random IoT / 3D printing / non-Tech related projects on home (just for fun)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... (all the stuff that requires my attention 👀)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with some personal and profit projects as well as some future open source "generators" (mostly around Laravel)
- 📫 How to reach me: ☕️ (send some coffee)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Yes, D8vjork from Bjork, basically the name came one of my student's days on a music class (those times...)
