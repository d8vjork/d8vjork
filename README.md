<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Rubén Robles Manrique</h1>
<h3 align="center">An all-rounder developer from Spain</h3>

🔭 I’m currently working founding an open-source focused company called [Open Southeners](https://github.com/open-southeners) (yes, it does commercial work, but all reusing open source of course)

🌱 Wanna learn some **Arduino (embedded systems), Swift & Rust**

🤝 Looking to help with **maintaining open source projects along commercial ones**, give me a shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/D8vjork) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d8vjork/)

📝 I regularly write articles on [my blog](https://blog.d8vjork.com), [open southeners' blog](https://opensoutheners.com) or [my company's (Skore)](https://skorelabs.medium.com)
